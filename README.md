# ZIPHero Documentation

A powerful ZIP file processor with repair capabilities and user-friendly interface.

# Important Note üö®üö®
### When running the .exe file for the first time, Windows Defender or other antivirus software may flag it as potentially unsafe. This is a common occurrence with executables created via PyInstaller, especially for smaller developers without a verified code-signing certificate.

### Why This Happens
Antivirus software sometimes misidentifies unsigned applications or compressed executables as threats due to their structure.
Rest assured, ZIPHero is safe to use and contains no malicious code.

### How to Proceed
Allow the application through your antivirus software.
If you're still concerned, review the source code (available on GitHub) and compile it yourself.
